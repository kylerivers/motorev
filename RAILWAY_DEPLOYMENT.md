## ðŸ”§ Admin Dashboard Access

### Admin API Endpoints

Your backend includes comprehensive admin controls:

1. **View All Users**
   ```
   GET https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/admin/users
   ```

2. **View Database Tables**
   ```
   GET https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/admin/table/users?limit=100&offset=0
   GET https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/admin/table/posts?limit=100&offset=0
   GET https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/admin/table/rides?limit=100&offset=0

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO users (username, email, password_hash, is_admin, created_at) 
   VALUES ('admin', 'admin@motorev.com', 'hashed_password', 1, NOW());
   ```

2. **Admin Login**
   ```
   POST https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/auth/login
   {

1. **Via Railway Dashboard**
   - Go to your MySQL service in Railway
   - Click "Connect" â†’ "MySQL Client"
   - Use the provided connection details

2. **Via MySQL Workbench**
   - Use the connection details from Railway

   - Database: motorev

3. **Via Command Line**
   ```bash
   # Install Railway CLI
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   
   # Login and connect
   railway login
   railway link
   railway connect
   ```

### Key Database Operations

1. **View All Users**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, username, email, created_at, is_admin, status 
   FROM users 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

2. **View User Activity**
   ```sql
   SELECT u.username, COUNT(r.id) as ride_count, 
          SUM(r.distance) as total_distance
   FROM users u
   LEFT JOIN rides r ON u.id = r.user_id
   GROUP BY u.id, u.username;
   ```

3. **Monitor Emergency Events**
   ```sql
   SELECT u.username, e.event_type, e.severity, e.created_at
   FROM emergency_events e
   JOIN users u ON e.user_id = u.id
   ORDER BY e.created_at DESC;
   ```

## ðŸ”’ Security & Permissions

### User Permission Levels

1. **Regular Users** (default)
   - Can create posts, rides, emergency events
   - Can follow other users
   - Can join group rides

2. **Verified Users**
   - All regular user permissions
   - Can create verified content
   - Higher visibility in social feed

3. **Admin Users**
   - Full database access
   - Can manage all users
   - Can view analytics
   - Can moderate content

### Content Moderation

1. **Flagged Content**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM posts WHERE is_flagged = 1;
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'suspended';
   ```

2. **Moderate User**
   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET status = 'suspended' WHERE id = ?;
   UPDATE users SET status = 'active' WHERE id = ?;
   ```

## ðŸ“ˆ Analytics & Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **User Growth**
   ```sql
   SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(*) as new_users
   FROM users 
   GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
   ORDER BY date DESC;
   ```

2. **Ride Activity**
   ```sql
   SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(*) as rides, 
          AVG(distance) as avg_distance
   FROM rides 
   GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
   ORDER BY date DESC;
   ```

3. **Emergency Events**
   ```sql
   SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) as count, 
          AVG(severity) as avg_severity
   FROM emergency_events 
   GROUP BY event_type;
   ```

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Response

### Real-time Monitoring

1. **Active Emergency Events**
   ```sql
   SELECT u.username, e.event_type, e.location, e.created_at
   FROM emergency_events e
   JOIN users u ON e.user_id = u.id
   WHERE e.status = 'active'
   ORDER BY e.created_at DESC;
   ```

2. **Emergency Contacts**
   ```sql
   SELECT u.username, ec.name, ec.phone_number, ec.relationship
   FROM emergency_contacts ec
   JOIN users u ON ec.user_id = u.id
   WHERE u.id = ?;
   ```
