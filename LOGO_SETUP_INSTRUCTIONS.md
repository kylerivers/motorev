# MotoRev Logo Setup Instructions

## Current Status ‚úÖ
- **Code is ready** - App looks for "MotoRevLogo" asset
- **Temporary fallback working** - Shows speedometer + motorcycle icon
- **Build successful** - Only warnings about missing image files

## How to Add Your Custom Logo

### Step 1: Prepare Your Logo Image Files üì∏

Take the motorcycle logo image you attached and create these files:

1. **Base image**: `moto-logo.png` (100x100 pixels recommended)
2. **Retina 2x**: `moto-logo@2x.png` (200x200 pixels)  
3. **Retina 3x**: `moto-logo@3x.png` (300x300 pixels)

### Step 2: Add Files to Asset Catalog üìÅ

Copy your prepared image files to this exact location:
```
MotoRev/Assets.xcassets/MotoRevLogo.imageset/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ moto-logo.png       (1x resolution)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ moto-logo@2x.png    (2x resolution)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ moto-logo@3x.png    (3x resolution)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Contents.json       (already exists)
```

### Step 3: Verify Setup ‚úÖ

1. Build the project: `xcodebuild -project MotoRev.xcodeproj -scheme MotoRev build`
2. The warnings about missing logo files should disappear
3. Your custom logo will appear on the splash screen in a circular frame

## What You'll See

**Before (current)**: Temporary speedometer + motorcycle SF Symbol icons  
**After**: Your custom circular motorcycle logo on splash screen

## Troubleshooting üîß

**Build warnings persist?**
- Check file names match exactly: `moto-logo.png`, `moto-logo@2x.png`, `moto-logo@3x.png`
- Verify files are in `MotoRev/Assets.xcassets/MotoRevLogo.imageset/`

**Logo doesn't appear?**
- Ensure images are PNG format
- Check that `Contents.json` exists in the folder
- Try cleaning build folder: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MotoRev-*`

## Current Fallback Design
The app currently shows a sleek black circle with:
- Background speedometer (subtle, 40pt, white opacity 30%)
- Front motorcycle icon (bold, 28pt, white)

This provides a professional look until your custom logo is added!
